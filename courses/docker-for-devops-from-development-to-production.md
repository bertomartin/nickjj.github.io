**From Docker novice to DevOps expert in about 7 hours**

Looking to level up your skills by deploying your own web application? How about
furthering your career by picking up years worth of general DevOps skills?

Prepare to get excited about Docker (and this course)!

Dozens of massive companies are using Docker every day but the awesome thing about
Docker is it works incredibly well even for the smallest projects.

Nowadays learning about Docker and general DevOps skills is gaining massive
momentum in the tech scene. It's similar to how mobile app development was a few
years ago.

Companies are EXPECTING new developers to manage the full life cycle of their
web applications. This means BOTH developing and deploying your apps.

Here's your chance to STAY AHEAD OF THE CURVE.

The Docker for DevOps course isn't just your run of the mill introduction to
Docker course, you can get that info by skimming Docker's website.

This course shows you WHAT you can build with Docker and HOW to do it -- of course
you'll learn the Docker basics along the way!

Together we'll walk through developing and deploying a multi-service Flask and
Ruby on Rails application.

Oh and don't worry, you won't need Flask or Ruby on Rails experience to understand
this course. The emphasis is on deploying a web application, not building one.

Learning by example is a great way to retain information and learn quickly.

  help you get your head straight. It starts at the real beginning and builds up
  to a full provisioning script, which is just pure awesomeness."
