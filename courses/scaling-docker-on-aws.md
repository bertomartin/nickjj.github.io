**Learn to deploy Docker at scale in about 6 hours**

Looking to scale your web applications with Docker? How about gaining heaps of
practical knowledge about working with Amazon Web Services (AWS)?

Prepare to get excited about this course!

AWS has over a million customers, some of which are the most popular websites
in the world. You can be sure that AWS will be a great fit for your web
application regardless of what scale you're running at.

**One awesome thing about using AWS** is that a ton of companies are hiring people
who have experience with it. All of the knowledge you gain from this
course can be used to apply for DevOps or cloud computing positions.

The main AWS component that you'll learn about in this course is Amazon ECS, which
is the Amazon EC2 Container Service. It's Amazon's take on how to manage a cluster
of Docker containers.

**The first section of this course** will concentrate on getting familiar with AWS
and then performing a deep dive on Amazon ECS where you'll learn everything there
is to know about it. You'll also get familiar with Amazon ECR which is Amazon's
private Docker registry.

During this deep dive there will be plenty of guided labs to get your hands dirty.

**The second section of this course** will be all about Dockerizing a multi-service
Ruby on Rails application, as well as profiling that application with Docker and
other open source tools.

If you're not a developer or have no intentions of using Ruby on Rails that's
fine because you can skip the development section. The only thing you'll have to
do is build the Docker image, which will be as simple as running a few commands.

**The third section of this course** will be taking the knowledge learned from
previous sections and deploying the application to production on AWS in a fault
tolerant way.

You'll learn how to calculate costs for a real life project hosted on AWS and
load balance the web application so you can scale out to as many hosts as you need.

Along the way you'll learn about many other AWS resources and also learn how to
hook up a domain name to a load balancer and secure it with a free SSL certificate.

*This entire course is very hands on*, with just enough theory to understand the
main goal -- which is to get you comfortable scaling your web apps with
Docker on AWS.
