### What is this repo?

This is [my personal website](http://nickjanetakis.com) that uses Jekyll 3 through
GitHub pages.

### What theme is it based off of?

It is based off of Hyde, which is a brazen two-column [Jekyll](http://jekyllrb.com)
theme that pairs a prominent sidebar with uncomplicated content. It's based on
[Poole](http://getpoole.com), the Jekyll butler.

### What modifications were done to Hyde?

Quite a lot. Off the top of my head, here's what I added or changed:

- A complete sidebar face lift
- Multiple pages
- Support for blog tags
- Support for a blog archive
- An atom page
- Responsive video and image CSS rules
- A bunch of additions and changes to `_config.yml`

### How would you use it on your site?

You'd fork this repo and then make sure to change a lot of values in `_config.yml`.
Obviously you'd want to delete my blog posts, other content and assets too.
