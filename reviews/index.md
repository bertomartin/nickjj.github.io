      "After several attempts to wrap my head around Docker, this is the first
      time I've walked away with a real understanding of how to leverage
      it in real world scenarios.</p>
      <p>I've known the benefits and familiarity with Vagrant, Chef and the like,
      I got the idea, but could never find anything up to date or a clear path to
      learning how to use it.</p>
      <p>The progressive approach from basics to advanced is well thought out and
      effective. Nick is an excellent instructor that speaks from a perspective I
      can relate to as a self taught developer.</p>
      <p>I really enjoyed the course and have and plan to continue to recommend it to others."

      a simple case study micro-services web application from development, staging

      "I got to know about this course via one of the Reddit threads that I
      stumbled upon while researching about "best way to deploy Flask applications",
      and I bought this course immediately, after that.</p>
      <p>I have been going through this course while creating & deploying my own
      application which I am building for my company, in parallel. This course has
      surpassed all my expectations and beyond.</p>
      <p>You have no idea how helpful this course have been for people like me
      who are beginners in application development, wrapping my head around Docker
      was very difficult but important as it is a necessity for deploying
      an application these days.</p>
      <p>There are few things I liked about this course:</p>
      <ol>
        <li>Speech Rate: Its neither fast nor slow. It's perfect for people to hear and understand. I have taken many other courses, where instructors talk either very slow that you tend to fall asleep or too fast to catch up on.</li>
        <li>Detailed Course: This course has covered almost everything that could be possibly required for any application developer. Nonetheless, there have been few things that I couldn't understand at once like Docker volumes but even for that Nick has responded to my questions the day I have asked on the course's forums, which are again very elaborative.</li>
        <li>Instant practical Implementation.</li>
        <li>Logically structured topics."</li>

      "The Docker for DevOps course is a very valuable resource -- worth far more
      than the price of admission. Nick Janetakis is very detailed in the lectures
      and provides many PDF downloads of notes and scripts.</p>
      <p>As a front-end developer for many years, I have found the server operations
      and setup to be very intimidating. Docker and other tools have made the process
      much more accessible. Nick Janetakis' Docker for DevOps course goes a step
      further, and makes these tools accessible.
