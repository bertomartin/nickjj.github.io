title: 'Why Sublime Text 3 Is Still My Preferred Code Editor'
tags: [dev-environment]
excerpt:
  I am still using Sublime Text 3 in 2016 because it stands up to my high
  demands as a full time developer and content creator.

After giving <a target="_blank" href="https://atom.io/">Atom</a> and
<a target="_blank" href="https://code.visualstudio.com/">Visual Studio Code</a>
both a fair test for months I'm back to using Sublime Text 3 and I'm not
looking back.

Why's that you might ask? It has the least amount of annoying little bugs that
you may encounter dozens of times a day with the above editors.

I only just realized how good Sublime Text 3 is after having not used it for
about half a year. I forgot how solid and fast it is. The community is
awesome too.

### What are my expectations in a code editor?

Well, I want it to sync up to my brain and just write the code as I think of it
but we're not quite there yet, so for now I will settle with:

##### Super fast and solid when I'm writing code

*Sublime is a champion in this department.*

The last thing I want to deal with is lag when I'm coding. I'm fortunate enough
to have an SSD and a pretty decent workstation (i5 quad core) but certain
editors do not feel good, at least not on Linux which is where I do my work.

I don't want to wait around for laggy code-complete windows, random 2 second
hitches or dealing with poor performance due to a buggy editor.

I also don't want to deal with random crashes through out the day, or having
to restart it after a bit because its performance deteriorates over time.

##### Extensible and customizable UI

*Recent versions of Sublime offer a good amount of UI tweakability.*

Let's face it, if you're staring at your editor for hours a day it should look
appealing to you. I don't want to make pretend it's still 1976.

I want something modern looking with a ton of different themes and color
schemes to choose from because I tend to get bored with color schemes quickly.

##### Really good syntax highlighting

*Sublime has syntax highlighting packages for everything I have ever needed.*

I'm not sure why but pleasant looking syntax highlighting makes me really
happy and since my technology list will grow in time, I want an editor that
will grow with me when it comes to supporting different file types.

##### Great writing experience

*Sublime's Markdown support is unmatched.*

As developers, we're often writing documentation. This could be for your own
projects or packages that you plan to open source.

My weapon of choice for that is Markdown so I want an editor with the best
possible Markdown experience I can find.

##### Mediocre auto-complete is OK

*Sublime has decent enough support for it with buffer-level completion.*

I used to be really hung up on things like this in the past, like OMG I can't
do anything without RubyMine's context aware auto-complete for Rails code but
honestly, it's not that important.

With Docker becoming more and more popular, editors need to re-think how they
determine where code is being loaded from.

At the moment not even RubyMine can pull in code that's sitting in a Docker
container, and I'm not willing to give up Docker just for auto-complete.

If you want access to library code on the fly, then you can use
tools like <a target="_blank" href="https://kapeli.com/dash">Dash</a> on OSX
or <a target="_blank" href="https://zealdocs.org/">Zeal</a> on Linux / Windows.
It has integration with Sublime through hotkeys.

If you haven't heard of Dash or Zeal before I recommend checking them out
because it's going to make your life way better when hunting for documentation.

##### Opens quickly

*Sublime opens in less than a second, it feels nearly instant.*

If I'm popping in and out of files on a regular basis, I don't want to sit and
wait for multiple seconds while a clunky editor loads.

You might say, well if you're working on a big project, you are only going to
generally open your editor once a day and that's totally true and I 100% agree
with you, but I'm constantly opening config files on my system too.

##### Quality of life improvements

*Sublime does a lot of little things right.*

There's a lot of little things you take for granted but when you step back and
think about them, you only then realize how useful they are.

For example here's a few things I love about Sublime:

- Selecting a word highlights every instance of that word in the buffer
- Fixing a spelling mistake is 1 right click away from being fixed
- Interacting with multiple split panes feels intuitive and good
- `CTRL+P` (enough said!)

### Is Sublime Text 3 perfect?

It's definitely not perfect, but for the time being it works and I no longer
feel the need to search for something better as my day to day editor.

What I'd really like to see is not another similar editor to Sublime, but
something that drastically changes how we interact with a code base and files.
