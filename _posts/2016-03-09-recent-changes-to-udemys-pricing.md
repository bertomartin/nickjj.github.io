  Udemy recently made a few changes to their platform when it comes to pricing,
  here's my opinion on those changes.

You may have read my previous article on why I was [disappointed with Udemy's
platform as an instructor a few months ago]({% post_url 2015-11-18-less-than-24-hours-on-udemy-as-an-instructor-and-i-am-close-to-leaving %}).

Since then a few things are scheduled to be changed on Udemy's platform in early
April 2016 and I'd like to talk about a few of those changes and how it relates
to my current opinion of their platform.

## New pricing strategy

Udemy previously let you pick whatever price you wanted for your course as long
as it was at least $9 and no more than $300.

This created a huge gap in prices, and it's partly why I initially chose $149
as my first course's price. I saw people with tens of thousands of students who
were charging $299 for their course.

I also saw a bunch of courses in my course's niche that were priced in a similar
range as mine. I naively thought I would be selling thousands of copies
at that price point.

That didn't really work as planned, but it's ok.

### Courses now have a much lower price cap

Starting in April 2016 instructors will be forced to price their courses between
$20 and $50, in $5 increments. So that means you will no longer see courses for
$49, or any number that doesn't end with a 0 or 5.

I've been selling my
<a href="{{ site.baseurl }}courses/docker-for-devops-from-development-to-production">Docker for DevOps course</a>
for $49 for the last few months now so overall I'm not too negatively impacted by
this. I could choose to pick $50 or experiment with even lower prices.

Udemy is now providing metrics to help ease into picking a new price. They are
showing you what your average sale price is for a course. This will account for
all discounts that either you or Udemy ran which resulted in a sale.

### Fixed price discounts will no longer exist

One of my biggest issues with Udemy was how they ran $10-15 fixed price promotions
pretty much constantly. This really killed any chances of generating organic
or self-promoted sales at your listed price.

It seems like Udemy is listening because now they are ditching the entire idea of
fixed price promotions.

In fact,
**I couldn't help but grin a little when I read this from Udemy's blog post**
that goes over the updates:

> We've heard directly from you, our instructor community, that fixed price deals
train students to wait for the lowest price and lead to an erosion of your average
selling price.

> We heard from our instructors that deep discounts were unsustainable and trained
students to purchase only at the lowest price.

The above quote almost felt like they were talking directly to me because in my
previous blog post about Udemy, which managed to cause a slight ruckus by trending
on HN for a few hours, it used the same terminology:

> Udemy students are trained to only ever buy courses for $10.

My post's premise was basically all about how students are trained by their
platform to only buy courses for the lowest possible fixed price discount, so
I'm really happy they listened and made this change.

I'm sure I wasn't the only instructor who ever had this problem.

### Percent based promotions are here to stay

Instead, Udemy is going to run percent based promotions which will max out at
50%. They didn't mention a low end, but chances are it will be in the 10-20%
range for their own promotions to students.

#### Why can't we have percent based coupons as instructors?

I still don't understand why they are forcing instructors to continue using
fixed price coupons.

Their coupon UI is still really bad. It will take hours to update all of the
old coupons due to this and the same problem will exist in the future if course
owners want to change prices.

## I spoke to a Udemy human on the phone

Since the above changes are pretty drastic, Udemy has paired up instructors like
you and me to Udemy employees who help manage instructors.

I found this to be pretty funny because if you open a support ticket, you'll
always be informed that Udemy doesn't have a phone number to reach a human but
now suddenly they can support calls from tens of thousands of instructors.

Anyways, **the phone call was really positive**. We scheduled a 30 minute call and
it ran on for 45 minutes because I asked a billion questions.

### A couple of main points from the conversation

I just wanted to share with you some of the biggest concerns I had. Keep in mind
that none of these answers are super official.

It was just a casual conversation between myself and a Udemy employee whose job
was to answer any questions I had about their platform.

Everything here is paraphrased based on questions I asked and answered received.

#### Will the lack of fixed promotions slow down sales?

I noticed most of my sales came from fixed price discounts, so I was concerned
that with them being removed then perhaps my course would stop selling so well.

I was informed that Udemy will continue to send out percent based promos, but
they won't be issued as aggressively as fixed based promotions.

The idea of this price change is to phase out the whole "training students to
only buy discounted courses".

#### Should I sell my course at its average sale price?

In case you didn't know, Udemy takes 50% of your sale so any drop in price is
a pretty large hit since you lose so much right off the bat.

On paper it would make sense to price your course around its average sale price
but there is a bias here because prices were constantly and drastically
lowered by the fixed price promotions.

What will likely happen for me is I'll sell the course for a bit less than its
current price but I haven't decided on an exact amount yet.

## Problems that still persist with Udemy

### The new review system is toxic

I've lost all form of valuable feedback from students due to this.

The new review system prompts students at various points in the course but it
completely disrupts the learning experience since it's a pop-up that interrupts
learning.

Students are just quickly clicking stars without thinking to remove the annoying
review prompt. This is natural because we're training to ignore pop-ups on the
internet. They are the worst thing ever for a positive user experience.

#### My average course rating has dropped from 4.9 to 4.5 in just a few weeks

The worst thing is that students are leaving these reviews with absolutely no
feedback at all, and students aren't replying to my requests for additional
feedback on their reviews.

So now as an instructor I'm getting all of these numeric reviews where students
are rating the course a 3 but give no feedback.

I'm left wondering what caused such a poor review and have 0 clue on how
to fix it because prior to this new review system students almost always left
informative reviews when they finished the course.

There used to be an aggregated anonymous feedback dashboard which actually gave
good feedback, but that's been completely removed since I guess it would be
prompting students too often for information.

#### Well off courses have a stupidly big advantage now

Any course that's been on their platform for a long time and has hundreds or
thousands of reviews now have an unbeatable advantage for ratings.

It's no mystery that all courses are going to go down in ratings from this change
but if you have thousands of 4.8+ reviews, then it will take a much larger amount
of slightly worse reviews to take down your average.

This is a huge issue IMO, and sure it will eventually fix itself over a few years
but having years of an unbeatable advantage is pretty broken.

### Additional issues

A lot of my previous blog post was unaddressed such as Udemy branding your videos
with watermarks without your content and heaps of other things, but that's a
story for perhaps the next Udemy related blog post.

## Where do I stand now?

Overall the pricing update is a very good start and so far I have no complaints
with it other than maybe $50 is questionable for a top end price.

That basically means niche courses have no chance of working on Udemy because you
can't even pick a higher price and then just self promote your own course.

It's pretty obvious they did this to circumvent instructors using their platform
in this way, and to also bring down course prices to maximize their revenue by
capitalizing on more courses being sold for cheaper prices with the lowest odds
of a refund.

I'll continue to use Udemy for current and future courses but I'm certainly
branching out to using other platforms as well. Especially platforms that give
me control over how I can interact with students and more attractive
revenue splitting percents.
