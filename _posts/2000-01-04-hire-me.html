<h3 class="header-contrast">Why you should hire me and how I will help you</h3>

<h4>Why would you work with me instead of an agency?</h4>
<p>I've seen too many people get seriously burned by agencies in the past. The work is often sub-par due to it being offloaded to inexperienced over-seas workers.</p>

<p>The people who make decisions at most agencies are often the people with the least amount of technical knowledge. Why would you want to spend the majority of your time talking to a middle man who has no idea how to come up with a solution to your problems?</p>

<p>Remember the telephone game we all played in elementary school? By the time it got to the third person the story changed entirely. With me, it's simple. You talk to me and I'm the one doing the work.</p>

<h4>How much does it cost to work with you?</h4>
<p>It really depends on the project. There's no secret formula or price chart that I try to pigeon hole clients into.</p>

<p>Once I have a strong grasp of what you want to do then I will come back at you with a proposal that is hand tuned for your business' needs.</p>

<h4>Why don't you have a portfolio page?</h4>
<p>Often times sites will change over time that are out of my control. For example if I created a site for a company 6 years ago and they've moved on since then, their site could very well be gone.</p>

<p>Long story short, I don't really care about boasting about all of the projects and websites I've been involved with. You're just going to have to trust me, I will also supply references on demand if you still question my abilities.</p>

<p>You're probably thinking "well, just host a copy on your own server". Sure I could do that, but again it's not worth the hassle. Let's focus on your business' needs, not mine.</p>

<h4>What type of work are you available to do?</h4>
<p>Web app development, website design, marketing, copywriting and infrastructure automation/management. I'm also capable of helping you create a brand and shape up your business ideas.</p>

<p>I also have extensive knowledge when it comes to the Shopify platform, for both theme creation and application development.</p>

<h4>Did you goto a university?</h4>
<p>Nah. I couldn't care less about a fancy piece of paper and I have no intentions of ever working at a place that highly values a degree.</p>

<p>That does not mean I'm against education though. In fact, it's the opposite. I love learning. That's part of why I enjoy what I do so much. I get to learn so much about so many things.</p>

<h4>Do you ever get burnt out?</h4>
<p>Nope, I really enjoy what I do. I'm not just doing this to cash checks. If I had 50 billion dollars sitting in the bank I would still be cranking out code and consulting with people.</p>

<p>Of course if that were the case I might be doing it from a 140 foot yacht while sailing around the world. So long as I had a reasonable internet connection of course.</p>

<h4>So, you work remotely then?</h4>
<p>A majority of it is remote but if you live near by then I don't have a problem meeting up somewhere to go over things in person. I do have a number of local clients.</p>

<p>Honestly, working remotely is faster and better for everyone. A lot of clients are skeptical at first but it's really easy to keep track of everything when it's done over e-mails or the phone.</p>

<p>Do you really want to sit in traffic to meet up for lunch somewhere? Instead of spending 20 minutes traveling, wouldn't it be better to spend 20 minutes getting something accomplished that drives your business forward?</p>
