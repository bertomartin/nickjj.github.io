### Rescue yourself from the complexity of DevOps

Learn how to Dockerize a web app in development and deploy it to production
in a secure way with the book,
[Deploy web apps with Docker](https://leanpub.com/deploy-web-apps-with-docker).

### What makes Docker so good?

Docker allows you to package an application with all of its dependencies into a
standardized unit for software development. Never again will you hit the brick
wall of "well it worked on my machine" because now what you're running in
development is extremely close to what's in production.

### Git push your code and then relax

Once you complete the book you will have the knowledge and a pre-made solution
that lets you git push code to either a staging or production server. All sorts
of interesting automated build tasks will occur and in the end, a shiny new
version of your app will be running without doing a thing.

### Here's just a few key topics the book covers

- Create a demo web application (easily apply it to your favorite framework)
- Create a staging environment with Vagrant and CoreOS
- Crash course with systemd
- Leverage nginx to handle SSL and to reverse proxy the app
- Git hooks to create automated builds
- Register on [Digital Ocean](https://www.digitalocean.com/?refcode=0a14c0d916b3) ($10 free credit)
- Register a domain name at rock bottom costs
- Obtain a free SSL certificate and hook it up

### Application deployment doesn't have to be painful

Save yourself from months of painful research and testing. With this book you
will be well on your way to deploying applications with Docker. You have nothing
to lose, there's a 45 day money back guarantee and it costs less than a pizza.
