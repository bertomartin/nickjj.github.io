---

I'm dabbling with the idea of doing long term travel in the future, so I decided
to visit Boston Massachusetts for 5 days as a test run.

I went in the middle of June 2016.

If you're interested in only pictures, here's a 
<a target="_blank" href="{{ site.baseurl }}galleries/2016-06-boston.html">
gallery with over 400 pictures </a> that I took through out the trip.

### Getting from New York to Boston

99.9% of this post will be about Boston but it's worth noting that if you live
on Long Island like me and you want to take the train then you will very likely
want to take the ferry over to Connecticut first.

Once in CT you can take an Amtrak train up to Boston. The Amtrak line runs from
Penn. Station in NYC too, but from CT it's 1.5 hours less time. If you're in
the middle or east end of Long Island then you save yourself a trip on the LIRR
too.

In my specific case it took 1 hour and 15 minutes to go from Port Jeff to CT by
ferry, then 3 hours by Amtrak from CT to Boston. The ferry drops you off in
Bridgeport, CT and the Amtrak station is a 3 minute walk.

If you're on the east end of Long Island you can take the Orient Point ferry
to New London instead. In this case, it will be way faster than taking the LIRR
to NYC.

If you book your tickets 2 weeks in advance it will only run you about $49 each
way. The ferry from Port Jeff is $34 for both ways. The LIRR is $26.50 for off
peak rates, so really you're paying $8 more to take a nice ferry ride and save
yourself roughly 2 hours of travel time. Totally worth it.

### Where will you sleep, AirBnB or a hotel?

I have never used AirBnB but I decided to try it. Downtown Boston was pretty
expensive. If you go the hotel route, expect to pay about $200/night.

AirBnBs in downtown Boston were around $150/night too.

I decided to shop around for places near Boston and went for a 1 private bedroom
house in Everett. The public transportation near Boston is pretty reasonable.

It was a 30 minute bus ride to downtown Boston and the buses all have air
condition which is a plus, especially when it gets packed in.

I stayed at 
<a target="_blank" href="https://www.airbnb.com/rooms/6636772">this place
for $45/night</a> at the time of booking it.

<a target="_blank" href="{{ site.baseurl}}galleries/2016-06-boston.html#&gid=1&pid=442">
  ![AirBnB room]({{ site.baseurl}}assets/img/galleries/2016-06-boston/443-everett-massachusetts-airbnb-room.jpg "AirBnB room")
</a>

It was a nice little room and the hosts were very cool. They stayed in the house
with me but I had a private bathroom. I actually left a review of it on the page
linked above if you want to hear my opinion on the place.

### Now the fun part, figuring out what to do for 5 days

This is the fun part, at least it was for me. I had no idea what to expect from
Boston but since I'm a software developer, I'm used to doing research.

About a week before the trip I spent a solid day just looking for things to do
in Boston and eventually came up with a list.

I like the idea of preparing for a trip, but I don't like the idea of set
schedules. If you try to go on a trip and plan things out to the exact minute
or hour then it's going to end up feeling like work and you won't have fun.

My approach was to come up with 15 things to do, and then do them as I went. I
didn't know the order I was going to do them in until I was there in Boston.

#### Definitely pay attention to hours of operation

When researching things, it's important to take note of when the attractions
you plan to visit are open. This isn't obvious, even though it seems like it
would be.

#### Take advantage of public transportation passes

There's this thing called the "7 day Charlie Pass" and for $19 you get unlimited
bus, subway and inner harbor ferry rides.

If you plan to stay for a number of days it's totally worth it. Even if you only
took the bus from your room to downtown Boston twice a day for 5 days you'd
come out ahead by purchasing the weekly pass.

By the end of my trip I calculated that I used $38 worth of public transportation
but I only ended up spending $19 on the pass.

#### Pre-load everything into your phone

I don't even have a smartphone (I'm serious), but I caved in and bought a $40
Samsung Stardust through TracFone just for the trip.

Then I topped it off with 180MB of data and 180 minutes of calling for $20. I
didn't care about calling, but it came included with the data plan.

Having access to Google Maps is very useful if you're in a new town. I feel like
I could have survived without it, but I would have had to print multiple maps
and also manually figure out the bus schedules.

If I had to do it again, I would totally bring the smartphone again. I was also
really surprised how efficient Google Maps was. It only used 23MB of data after
5 days of heavy location based GPS tracking.

Anyways, you should definitely star/label all of the places you plan to check
out because then it's super simple to get To/From directions.

### Copley Square and the Boston Public Library

My train dropped me off in the Back Bay station which is in a great location in
downtown Boston. It was only a 3 minute walk to Copley Square and the main
Boston Public Library.

The bus station to get to my AirBnB was a 30 minute walk from here but that was
perfect after sitting on a train for 3 hours.

<a target="_blank" href="{{ site.baseurl}}galleries/2016-06-boston.html#&gid=1&pid=15">
  ![Boston Public Library near Copley Square]({{ site.baseurl}}assets/img/galleries/2016-06-boston/015-boston-public-library-seen-from-copley-square.jpg "Boston Public Library near Copley Square")
</a>

I was blown away at how clean Boston was. Seriously, I would have felt comfortable
walking around most of the entire downtown area barefoot.

The sidewalks and streets were in excellent shape with no garbage to be seen.

<a target="_blank" href="{{ site.baseurl}}galleries/2016-06-boston.html#&gid=1&pid=16">

</a>

### Soaking in the town on the first day

I spent most of the first day just walking around town aimlessly because I
arrived in Boston around 2pm.

That was a bit too late to hit up any main attractions, but still early enough
to have a great day so I walked around town for a few hours with my only piece
of luggage which was a 15 pound backpack.

By around 5pm I decided to head up to the AirBnB. I unpacked and then walked
around Everett for a while. There's a few pictures of that in the
<a target="_blank" href="{{ site.baseurl}}galleries/2016-06-boston.html#&gid=1&pid=20">
  photo gallery I set up for the trip
</a>.

By around 8pm I was pretty shot. I was up the entire night beforehand because
who can sleep the night before a trip? Also I had left my place at 7am.

I got a chance to meet my AirBnB hosts that night and we talked for a bit.
Unfortunately I couldn't sleep much that night because I'm weird when it comes
to sleeping in new locations.

I eventually fell asleep around 4am, but at about 5am I woke up with one of their
cats sniffing my eyeball. Yep, that freaked me out. That's when I learned that
cats can open doors.

### Boston Museum of Science

Despite not sleeping much I wasn't tired, so I left the AirBnB pretty early.

After hitching a ride to downtown Boston on the bus I walked over to the Boston
Museum of Science which wasn't too far at all.

<a target="_blank" href="{{ site.baseurl}}galleries/2016-06-boston.html#&gid=1&pid=68">
  ![Boston Museum of Science central room]({{ site.baseurl}}assets/img/galleries/2016-06-boston/068-boston-museum-of-science-central-open-room.jpg "Boston Museum of Science central room")
</a>

The place was massive. I haven't really visited any museums so I wasn't sure
what to expect. I was blown away at how many exhibits it had and how efficient
the building was laid out.

The museum covered a lot of different topics. You'll see insects, dinosaur bones,
human anatomy, rocks, nature, machines and so much more.

I was able to spend 6 hours there without trying and I didn't even goto most of
the paid events. That was time spent only in the open exhibit halls.

I highly recommend spending the extra $6 to visit the planetarium. I ended up
seeing the universe show and it was well worth it. It's also worth checking out
the lightning show in the exhibit hall which is a free event that runs every few hours.

Before leaving the museum area, make sure to cross the Charles river. There was
a nice little park to walk around and it only took a few minutes to get there.

<a target="_blank" href="{{ site.baseurl}}galleries/2016-06-boston.html#&gid=1&pid=83">
  ![Boston Museum of Science across the bridge]({{ site.baseurl}}assets/img/galleries/2016-06-boston/083-boston-museum-of-science-charles-river-view.jpg "Boston Museum of Science across the bridge")
</a>

### DCR Hatch Memorial Shell

I decided to walk down the Boston side of the Charles river from the Museum of Science
and came across this place. I didn't plan to visit it, but it was pretty nice.

<a target="_blank" href="{{ site.baseurl}}galleries/2016-06-boston.html#&gid=1&pid=92">
  ![Boston DCR Hatch Memorial Shell]({{ site.baseurl}}assets/img/galleries/2016-06-boston/092-boston-massachusetts-dcr-hatch-memorial-shell.jpg "Boston DCR Hatch Memorial Shell")
</a>

Supposedly the town puts on a lot of events here, but nothing was happening at
the time of my visit.

By the time I made my way here I was ready to get dinner. If you were to turn
around in the above picture, you would see the Charles River Bistro.

This was a casual place to get lunch or dinner. It reminded me of a beach shack.

I ended up getting an angus burger and a fruit cup for about $7. Not too shabby.
The service was good and it was enjoyable to eat dinner outside near the water.

### Boston Public Gardens

Next up I headed over to the Boston Public Gardens. It is well known for being in
immaculate condition and for hosting various events.

<a target="_blank" href="{{ site.baseurl}}galleries/2016-06-boston.html#&gid=1&pid=94">
  ![Boston Public Gardens]({{ site.baseurl}}assets/img/galleries/2016-06-boston/094-boston-massachusetts-public-garden.jpg "Boston Public Gardens")
</a>

I'm not really someone who is into flowers or gardening but I can appreciate
the workmanship that was put into this place.

It ended up being a really enjoyable park to walk through and had monuments to
look at such as George Washington (check out the full photo gallery).

### Boston Commons

Right next to the garden are the Boston Commons. I don't know the exact cut off
line but I think it's Charles St. which splits the 2 landmarks in half.

It's another well kept park that's quite a bit bigger. You'll find people playing
frisbee, bean bag tossing and other games in this vast open space.

<a target="_blank" href="{{ site.baseurl}}galleries/2016-06-boston.html#&gid=1&pid=101">
  ![Boston Commons]({{ site.baseurl}}assets/img/galleries/2016-06-boston/101-boston-massachusetts-commons-2.jpg "Boston Commons")
</a>

Unlike the garden, you're allowed to go on the grass here.

If you want to get a map of the city or look for tourist attractions this is
the spot to visit because it's where the Boston Common Visitors Center is.

### Faneuil Hall / Freedom trail

This hall is interesting because it's where you can sign up for the freedom
trail that runs through out the city.

<a target="_blank" href="{{ site.baseurl}}galleries/2016-06-boston.html#&gid=1&pid=111">
  ![Boston Faneuil Hall]({{ site.baseurl}}assets/img/galleries/2016-06-boston/111-boston-massachusetts-faneuil-hall.jpg "Faneuil Hall")
</a>

These are 1 hour walks around the city where you can get a guided or unguided
tour of famous historic landmarks.

There's a few different trails. I took the one that ended with the Boston tea
party.

The guided tour is normally a paid event but if you go inside Faneuil Hall you
can sign up for a free guided tour with a park ranger.

I decided to do that and it was worth it because the ranger giving the tour
has been trained for public speaking. She made it very entertaining and even
got the crowd involved for some of the tour.

I learned a lot, but honestly it was super interesting to me mainly because as
a  <a target="_blank" href="{{ site.baseurl}}courses/">content creator myself</a>,
I got a lesson on how to improve my delivery by watching her work the crowd (we
went out with about 30 people).

### North End

The North End section of downtown Boston is famous for having some of the best
Italian food in the country. It's also where Paul Revere's house is.

It's an upscale neighborhood with very narrow streets and red brick buildings.

<a target="_blank" href="{{ site.baseurl}}galleries/2016-06-boston.html#&gid=1&pid=122">
  ![Boston North End]({{ site.baseurl}}assets/img/galleries/2016-06-boston/122-boston-massachusetts-north-end-2.jpg "Boston North End")
</a>

*My fingers got jealous, so I made sure to include them in this picture.*

I didn't end up eating anywhere here but I did explore the whole area. It was
an interesting zone because it felt like I was transported to a different time.

The outskirts of North End had a few really nice views on the water too.

<a target="_blank" href="{{ site.baseurl}}galleries/2016-06-boston.html#&gid=1&pid=126">
  ![Boston North End outskirts]({{ site.baseurl}}assets/img/galleries/2016-06-boston/126-boston-massachusetts-north-end-6.jpg "Boston North End outskirts")
</a>

### Christopher Columbus Waterfront Park

I didn't spend too much time here but it was worth checking out mainly because
it's on the way to the Long Wharf ferry and the water views were fantastic.

<a target="_blank" href="{{ site.baseurl}}galleries/2016-06-boston.html#&gid=1&pid=134">
  ![Boston Christopher Columbus Waterfront Park]({{ site.baseurl}}assets/img/galleries/2016-06-boston/134-boston-massachusetts-christopher-columbus.jpg "Christopher Columbus Waterfront Park")
</a>

If you're into history then you'll certainly want to check it out.

### Long Wharf ferry port

This is the entry point to take a ferry over to the Charleston Navy Yard. It's a
free trip if you have the 7 day Charlie Pass and it only takes about 10 or 15
minutes.

I really enjoy port towns. There were so many people just hanging out.

<a target="_blank" href="{{ site.baseurl}}galleries/2016-06-boston.html#&gid=1&pid=138">
  ![Long Wharf ferry port]({{ site.baseurl}}assets/img/galleries/2016-06-boston/138-boston-massachusetts-long-wharf-ferry-4.jpg "Long Wharf ferry port")
</a>

The ferry ride was smooth and offered awesome views from the top of the boat.

<a target="_blank" href="{{ site.baseurl}}galleries/2016-06-boston.html#&gid=1&pid=141">
  ![Long Wharf ferry]({{ site.baseurl}}assets/img/galleries/2016-06-boston/141-boston-massachusetts-long-wharf-ferry-7.jpg "Long Wharf ferry")
</a>

If you're lucky, you might even see a pirate ship.

<a target="_blank" href="{{ site.baseurl}}galleries/2016-06-boston.html#&gid=1&pid=143">
  ![Long Wharf pirates]({{ site.baseurl}}assets/img/galleries/2016-06-boston/143-boston-massachusetts-long-wharf-ferry-9.jpg "Long Wharf pirates")
</a>

### Charleston Navy Yard Museum

This place was pretty interesting. Not only did it have an indoor museum but it
also has 2 large ships outside that you can board.

<a target="_blank" href="{{ site.baseurl}}galleries/2016-06-boston.html#&gid=1&pid=151">
  ![Charleston Navy Yard Museum]({{ site.baseurl}}assets/img/galleries/2016-06-boston/151-boston-massachusetts-charlestown-navy-yard-museum-5.jpg "Charleston Navy Yard Museum")
</a>

The museum wasn't massive but it's worth checking out. You'll get a real idea
of what it was like to be a sailor a few hundred years ago.

I wouldn't consider myself someone who is really into Navy history but I had a
really fun time at this museum and learned quite a lot.

#### USS Constitution

This is a ship that you're allowed to board, but be warned that you will need
to empty your pockets and put all bags through a scanner before being allowed
on.

This precaution is mainly because it's still in commission.

<a target="_blank" href="{{ site.baseurl}}galleries/2016-06-boston.html#&gid=1&pid=163">
  ![USS Constitution]({{ site.baseurl}}assets/img/galleries/2016-06-boston/163-boston-massachusetts-charlestown-navy-yard-uss-constitution-2.jpg "USS Constitution")
</a>

Once aboard you can explore above and below deck. There's even a Navy crewman
who will give you a brief history recap of the ship.

#### USS Cassin Young

This is a destroyer ship that I'm pretty sure you're allowed to board normally.
Sadly it was closed at the time I went, but I did see welcoming bridges to go
on. Perhaps it was just too late in the day when I went.

<a target="_blank" href="{{ site.baseurl}}galleries/2016-06-boston.html#&gid=1&pid=168">
  ![USS Cassin Young]({{ site.baseurl}}assets/img/galleries/2016-06-boston/168-boston-massachusetts-charlestown-navy-yard-uss-cassin-young-2.jpg "USS Cassin Young")
</a>

I would have liked to walk on it -- maybe next time!

#### USS Boston

The last main attraction to see are the guns at the end of the pier. Not only
is there history behind them but it offers a nice skyline view of the city.

<a target="_blank" href="{{ site.baseurl}}galleries/2016-06-boston.html#&gid=1&pid=175">
  ![USS Boston]({{ site.baseurl}}assets/img/galleries/2016-06-boston/175-boston-massachusetts-charlestown-navy-yard-uss-boston-guns.jpg "USS Boston")
</a>

### Bunker Hill

If you're up near the Charleston Navy Yard Museum then you should definitely
check out Bunker Hill as it's only a short walk over to it.

You can even climb it. It's a steep 254 steps up but be warned that you can only
climb it during certain hours.

At the time I went the last climb was 4:30pm which I didn't know beforehand. I
ended up missing it by 20 minutes. Maybe next time!

<a target="_blank" href="{{ site.baseurl}}galleries/2016-06-boston.html#&gid=1&pid=180">
  ![Boston Bunker Hill]({{ site.baseurl}}assets/img/galleries/2016-06-boston/180-boston-massachusetts-charlestown-bunker-hill-william-prescott-6.jpg "Boston Bunker Hill")
</a>

It's still a very cool piece of history to check out regardless of the climb.
The monument is so tall once you get to it.

I never knew William Prescott looked like such a bad-ass.

### Harvard Campus

Next on the list was Harvard which is located in Cambridge. It's a short subway
ride on the T line from downtown Boston.

I recommend carving out a full day if you plan to go here because there's an
excellent museum to visit and MIT is also very close which is worth checking out.

The Harvard area itself has a lot of interesting architecture.

<a target="_blank" href="{{ site.baseurl}}galleries/2016-06-boston.html#&gid=1&pid=199">
  ![Harvard]({{ site.baseurl}}assets/img/galleries/2016-06-boston/200-cambridge-massachusetts-harvard-7.jpg "Harvard")
</a>

You're allowed to walk around the campus. I found it to be hilarious because I
saw roughly 50 million Chinese tourists walking around taking pictures.

I even overheard others saying things like "I can't believe how overrun this place
is with tourists. I would never pay to goto school in this atmosphere".

I have nothing against Chinese people or tourists but it was funny to me because
I envisioned the campus as a really exclusive and upscale place.

I thought girls would be sitting outside drinking tea with their pinkies up while
guys played badminton in their sweater vests.

### Harvard Museum of Natural History

I almost didn't goto this museum because I thought it was free due to an event
that was going on, but it wasn't.

I'm really happy I talked myself into dropping the $12 to go in it because it
was epic. It was much different than the Boston Museum of Science.

There were all sorts of pre-historic animals and stuffed life sized versions of
them. Getting to see a siberian tiger up close blew my mind. It was about 12
feet long and its paws were large enough to rip your face off in 1 swipe.

If you're into rocks and gems you're going to love this place too. There were
so many interesting things to look at.

<a target="_blank" href="{{ site.baseurl}}galleries/2016-06-boston.html#&gid=1&pid=301">
  ![Harvard Museum of Natural History Rocks]({{ site.baseurl}}assets/img/galleries/2016-06-boston/302-cambridge-massachusetts-harvard-museum-of-natural-history-100.jpg "Harvard Museum of Natural History Rocks")
</a>

There were also exhibits on human history. I came across a weapon rack here
that reminded me of an old game I used to play called Diablo 2.

<a target="_blank" href="{{ site.baseurl}}galleries/2016-06-boston.html#&gid=1&pid=359">
  ![Harvard Museum of Natural History Weapons]({{ site.baseurl}}assets/img/galleries/2016-06-boston/360-cambridge-massachusetts-harvard-museum-of-natural-history-158.jpg "Harvard Museum of Natural History Weapons")
</a>

I took over 100 pictures of this place, so make sure to check out the photo
gallery. I spent around 2 hours there without breaking a sweat.

If you go there, make sure to check out the glass flower exhibit. I didn't take
any pictures because no flash cameras were allowed.

It was an incredible place to visit. The flowers were all made of glass but they
looked natural. There's no way you would have been able to tell without knowing
beforehand.

### Harvard Peabody Museum of Archeology and Ethnology

This museum is across the street from the Museum of Natural History and it's
free admission. It's very small but worth checking out while you're there.

You'll gain insight on ancient Egyptians and other civilizations.

<a target="_blank" href="{{ site.baseurl}}galleries/2016-06-boston.html#&gid=1&pid=401">
  ![Harvard Peabody Museum of Archeology and Ethnology]({{ site.baseurl}}assets/img/galleries/2016-06-boston/402-cambridge-massachusetts-harvard-peabody-museum-of-archeology-and-ethnology-11.jpg "Harvard Peabody Museum of Archeology and Ethnology")
</a>

### MIT Campus

MIT is very close to Harvard so definitely plan to check both of them out in 1
outing if you're interested.

You can go by subway or take the 2 mile walk. I ended up taking the subway
because I was pretty pressed for time. At this point it was around 4pm and I
had an Android meet-up in downtime Boston at 7pm.

The MIT campus had a lot of interesting architecture. For example, here's the
buildings that house its data center.

<a target="_blank" href="{{ site.baseurl}}galleries/2016-06-boston.html#&gid=1&pid=414">
  ![MIT data center]({{ site.baseurl}}assets/img/galleries/2016-06-boston/415-cambridge-massachusetts-mit-data-center.jpg "MIT data center")
</a>

There were dozens of buildings and things to explore. I recommend going to the
visitor's center and either taking a guided tour by one of the students or taking
the self guided map tour.

Since I got there so late I did a brief self guided tour but only got a chance
to explore a tiny fraction of the campus.

Make sure to check out the infinite hallway. It was a massive indoor hallway
with a lot of interesting things to look at as you passed various rooms.

There were much less tourists here and it really felt like a legit campus.

### Back Bay love locks

While heading to my final destination of the Mapparium in downtown Boston I came
across a pretty cool bridge. I had no idea this existed until I walked past it.

<a target="_blank" href="{{ site.baseurl}}galleries/2016-06-boston.html#&gid=1&pid=444">
  ![Back Bay love locks]({{ site.baseurl}}assets/img/galleries/2016-06-boston/445-boston-massachusetts-love-locks-back-bay.jpg "Back Bay love locks")
</a>

I wouldn't say I'm a padlock enthusiast but it was really interesting to look at
up close. There's so many different lock types and I've never seen anything like
it.

### Mapparium

One of the last things on my list was to check out the Mapparium. It's this really
neat planetarium-like structure to look at.

It's a 3 story stained-glass globe that shows the world as of 1935. You get to
walk inside of the room on top of a transparent bridge and a guide explains
the history behind it, and how the world changed over the years.

Unfortunately they were very strict about taking photographs but you can find
some on their 
<a target="_blank" href="http://www.marybakereddylibrary.org/project/mapparium/">
  official website</a>.

The acoustics in the room were incredibly creepy. You could stand across the
bridge and hear someone whisper from the other side.

Also if you stood in the middle of the room you could hear sounds bounce around
from everywhere because the curved glass walls reflect sound back rather than
absorb it. You really have to experience it first hand.

The below picture is a neat fountain in the lobby area where a projector displays
words onto moving water.

I am curious to hear what places you saw in Boston because I am very confident
that I'll be going back at some point in the future.
