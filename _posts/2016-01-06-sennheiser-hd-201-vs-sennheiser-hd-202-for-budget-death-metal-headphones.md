  what I thought about both of these headphones.

### What type of music do I listen to?

I listen to all sorts of music. Everything from the craziest deathcore bands you
could possibly imagine, to trance and classical music.

The majority of what I listen to could be labeled as melodic death metal or
deathcore. How you label it isn't important, the point of this post is to compare
2 budget headphones that are commonly referred to as the best sub-$100 headphones
available and both cost less than $30.

Here's a couple of songs from my play list that I compared the headphones against:

*I recommend listening to the intros to these songs and then skip around to get
a general idea. These are listed in the order they are in my play list, not
preference.*

### Am I a good judge to compare headphones?

Maybe. I'm a software developer and I tend to wear headphones quite often for
extended periods of time. I also play the guitar as a hobby but I don't have any
expensive headphones to compare the quality to.

I don't think that matters because this post is about budget headphones.
I am sure you could find something better than either of these if you don't mind
dropping $150 or $350+ on a pair.

### Sennheiser HD 201

**Price:** $16  
**Release date:** April 2005  
**I used them for:** 4 years

#### Comfort level:
Very comfortable. The ear cups on the headphones encase your ears in an open
way, meaning you feel very little pressure. I've gone years of wearing them for
8+ hours a day without issues. You can barely notice they are on.

They felt great from the moment I put them on.

### Sennheiser HD 202 II

**Price:** $25  
**Release date:** May 2010  
**I used them for:** 1 day

#### Comfort level:
Not too good. The ear cups are much smaller than the 201s and the head band is
much less wide than the 201s.

Imagine what it would feel like if an alien parasite were trying to crush your
skull. Even after expanding them and trying to bend them outward, I could feel my
heart beat pulse in my temple.

I'm going to assume they will stretch out naturally but one thing is for sure,
the 201s were never remotely close to this uncomfortable.

### Bottom line comparison

I went in wanting to upgrade my 201s but I can't just do it. Out of all of the
songs listed above and more the overall quality is simply worse with the 202s.

The 202s have so much more bass, but it's not bass in a good way. The break downs
all sound worse and the highs on the 202 are incredibly condensed sounding and
awful. The mids are drowned out too. I'm honestly surprised the 202s have such
high ratings.

The 201s sound much more thin compared to the 202s because your ears aren't
suffocated to the point where they hurt and the bass is much more level. The highs
sound much more natural and the mids are clear.

My question to you is, what's your opinion on both of these headphones, or better
yet, can you recommend a pair of headphones in the $50 or less range that out
perform the Sennheiser HD 201s?
