I want to create an online course that teaches developers how to use Docker.

Like my previous course
<a target="_blank" href="{{ site.baseurl }}courses/build-a-saas-app-with-flask">
  Build a SAAS app with Flask</a>
it will be packed with knowledge that I've obtained while working as a developer
and consultant for years. It will cover a lot of ground.

      Build a SAAS app with Flask</a> course at a tremendous discount.</p>

    <p>You'll be able to follow step by step regardless of what operating system you
    use. There will also be an example app provided in Flask and Ruby on Rails so
    you can follow along with a variety of popular web frameworks.</p>

    <p>You'll learn how to use Docker, setup a staging server, deploy a secure web
    app over SSL and host everything on a major cloud provider with a custom domain
    name.</p>
