Over the years, I've been asked a number of questions. This is a list of answers
to those questions as well as a few tidbits of information that didn't fit anywhere
else.

Want to ask me a question? No problem,
<a href="mailto:{{ site.author.email }}">contact me by e-mail</a> with your question.

### How did you learn everything you know?
Practice and a deep desire to actually learn the thing I'm actively learning.

Every language or framework I've learned had at least 1 project in mind that
drove me forward. I'm not one of those people who can sit there and read a 400
page book on a specific language and then suddenly be an expert.

I learn best my example, and by trying things out. That's why my courses are all
about building practical examples. Sure, they have theory when it makes sense,
but really nothing beats getting your hands dirty and playing with the code.

### Did you goto a University?
Nope. Pretty much started hacking away on code during high school and self learned
all the way through by just tackling real life problems that came my way.

I did take 2 on-line courses which were pretty interesting.

The first course was
<a target="_blank" href="https://www.edx.org/course/introduction-computer-science-harvardx-cs50x">
CS50x on edX</a>. I took this course mainly to learn the basics of C and I heard the
professor was epic. Knowing just enough C to be dangerous and how memory
works is a very valuable skill to have. Highly recommended!

The second course was
<a target="_blank" href="https://www.edx.org/course/introduction-computer-science-mitx-6-00-1x-6">
600.1x on edX</a>. I mainly took this just to see what I was missing in terms of
CS theory. It was a pretty thorough course but I don't feel like I walked away
with too much but your mileage may vary.

### What's your favorite thing about programming?
That's really hard to answer because I like almost every aspect of it. I enjoy
building things. For me it's very relaxing to just put on headphones, crank up
some melodic death metal and build something.

Every aspect is interesting. The initial planning, putting it all together, and
discovering things you didn't even knew existed. Unless it's a specific tool that
I gain value from using, the end result is usually the least interesting to me.

### Did you ever want to just give up programming?
Sure did. When I was younger and much less experienced I gave up a few times for
at least a few months at a time.

Then I basically said fuck this shit. This is what I like doing it, every mistake
or mishap along the way is one step closer to being better.

It wasn't until I fully understood that the key to everything is breaking problems
down into smaller problems that I came became motivated to stick with it.

### What's your favorite general programming books?
I'm not a huge book reader but 2 books immediately came to mind. Both books are
quite old in terms of publication dates but they contain timeless knowledge that
can be applied to whatever language you're working with.

##### The Pragmatic Programmer: From Journeyman to Master
<a target="_blank" href="http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/4099.The_Pragmatic_Programmer">http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/4099.The_Pragmatic_Programmer</a>

### How did you get started with open source?
I created a GitHub account and started pushing terrible code. Some of my older
repos have pretty embarrassing code but you just need to get over yourself.

I really don't care what anyone thinks of old code I've written on an open source
project that may or may not have gained any traction and hasn't been used by
myself in years.

Just make sure you start every project you plan to make public with a README
file and do your best to document things. Clean up the code base when it's a tool
that you're actively maintaining or is worth your time in some way or another.

### What editor do you use?
I tend to use what I feel like is the best tool for the job today. I've used
vim, emacs, Sublime, Atom, Visual Studio and a few of IDEA's editors over the years.

After some bouncing around 
[I'm back to using Sublime Text 3]({% post_url 2016-04-13-why-sublime-text-3-is-still-my-preferred-code-editor %})
because as time goes on, I find myself working with many different languages
and file types and I'm willing to give up context aware code complete to use
1 editor.

### Are you a full stack developer?
Depends on what your definition of that is. I wouldn't consider myself an artist
or front-end specialist. I feel like I have a reasonable idea of general UX skills
and typically heavily modify existing themes to do whatever I need them to do.

I'm much more interested in back-end development and ops. Front end wise, I
typically share a similar mindset as DHH (the author of Rails) when it comes to
front-end frameworks.

I'm content using server rendered templates and sprinkling in partial page reloads
for content that needs to be updated on the fly via websockets or ajax.

### What's your go to tech stack for new projects?
Without any other context I would say Postgres, Redis and nginx would fit into
any new web application I'd end up building.

Throw in Elasticsearch if you need full text search features that don't exist in
Postgres or you require additional features that ES offers.

Then for the web framework side of things, I'd likely reach for Ruby on Rails but
Flask definitely has its place too. It depends on the project's requirements.

### How long did it take you to learn Rails?
Prior to learning Rails I already had some experience with web development and
understood the MVC pattern. It took me around 3 months of actively researching it
while working on a personal project to feel like I kind of knew what I was doing.

I'm actually a late bloomer with Rails. I started when 4.0 was released, so there
was already a ton of documentation and community support available.

### What's your rate?
I'm a big fan of charging by project or by week rather than by hour but I will
bill out by the hour for smaller scoped projects when it makes sense.

Typically I find clients who stress out about hourly rates are difficult and lame
to work with. They are more concerned with getting the cheapest rate instead of
concentrating on creating the best solution for them.

Talk to me about your current idea and we'll figure something out. Feel free to
call me on {{ site.author.phone }} or
<a href="mailto:{{ site.author.email }}">send me an e-mail</a>.

### Do you only work remotely?
I'm not opposed to commuting but it has to make sense to do so. For instance, I
don't live in NYC but if you want me to work in NYC then you're going to have to
make it worth my while to commute 3 hours a day and pay travel fees.

Often times, working remotely makes a lot more sense and we can meet in person
occasionally if you happen to be semi-local. Google Hangouts is a great gap
closer with desktop sharing for both semi-local and long range clients.

### Would you be willing to re-locate for a job?
I wouldn't say it's impossible but it's not something I'm actively looking for.

If a great offer came by for a long term contract that involved me moving somewhere
for a decent period of time, that could be a pretty cool life experience.

### What's your favorite thing about consulting?
It's definitely getting to work on projects in industries that are new for me.
Spending a few months on a project and then being able to work on something brand
new is very refreshing and also challenging.

This goes back to a previous answer about how my
<a href="#whats-your-favorite-thing-about-programming">favorite thing about
programming</a> is building things. Being a consultant allows me to constantly
build new things and that makes me happy.
